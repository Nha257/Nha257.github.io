I'm Noah H. Ali. I am currently a junior at Lehigh University in the College of Arts and Sciences. I am majoring in Science Journalism and Health, Medicine, and Society (HMS), as well as minoring in philosophy. That basically just means I do a lot of writing, and usually it is about science, health, or the way people think. Some of my hobbies are photography, creative writing, playing video games, and just asking a lot of questions.

## **Le-Laf Rivalry Infographic:**
This is another infographic I did regarding the Lehigh-Lafayette Rivalry. I know there's a lot of data surrounding the game, and it's a huge part of the culture of Lehigh, so I thought it would be interesting to make an infographic on it. Some notable data I learned was that rivalry started in 1884. Lafayette has won 79 games, Lehigh 72, and there has been 5 draws. I also included some other Lehigh traditions on the graphic such as the Turkey Trot, Bed Racing, and Banner Making which are a big part of rivalry week. I got the data from the [Lafayette Athletics Website.](https://goleopards.com/sports/football/opponent-history/lehigh-university/143#:~:text=Wins,18.27)

## **History of Mascots at Lehigh Timeline:**

I did another timeline as well on the history of mascots at Lehigh. I know Lehigh has changed its mascot from the Engineers to Clutch., which was kind of a big deal among some alumni, and I thought it would be interesting to see how the mascot has changed over the years at Lehigh. Originally, Lehigh just had to come up with a mascot in 1882 since they since Lafayette asked them to play a football game. They went with Engineers as a reference to Asa Packer. In the 1920's Lehigh had a dog named Clarence who apparently could predict scores, and acted as unofficial mascot. Finally, in 1995 the Mountain Hawk was made Lehigh's mascot in reference to the mountainous region the campus is on, and the hawks in the area. He was officially named Clutch as a resutlt from a student contest in 2008, and he has gone by that name as our mascot since. Some sources I used were [one about dogs at Lehigh](https://alumni.lehigh.edu/news-blog/dogs-lehigh#:~:text=Dogs%20in%20History,leaving%20her%20fraternity%20brothers%20bereft.), a 2013 Lehigh Sports article about [the Mountain Hawk](https://lehighsports.com/sports/2013/6/4/GEN_0604135643), a article about Lehigh [uniforms throughout history](https://lehighsports.com/news/2014/6/25/LL150_0625143915), and two _Brown and White_ articles about Clutch's history, one from [2021](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2021/11/19/from-engineers-to-mountain-hawks/) and the other from [2022.](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2022/11/18/the-clutch-experience-history-and-impact-of-lehighs-mascot/#:~:text=By%20William%20Barnett%20November%2018,the%20students%20decided%20on%20Clutch.)

## **Outcomes of U.S. Animal Shelters 2024:**

This is a chart I made explaining the outcomes of animals in U.S. shelters of the year 2024:
<iframe title="Results of Shelter Animals Outcomes in 2024" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-QsqTg" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QsqTg/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="463" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>
Live outcomes include things such as adoptions, returning animals to owners, return-to-field, and other things along those lines. Non-live outcomes are things such as euthanasia, animals being lost, or dying in care. On a positive note, there are way more live-outcomes than non-live ones, as indicated by the graph. There are also more animals being added to shelters and taken care of then animals being taken out of them, though the gap is on the smaller end. This is most likely due to shelters being overwhelmed and a lack of resources, showing these areas need improvement. Data was collected from [Shelter Animal Count's 2024 statistics](https://www.shelteranimalscount.org/explore-the-data/statistics-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## **Map of 2024 Meteor Crash Site Locations:**

I did a map of meteor crashes from 2024. I picked this because I think it tells a story that translates very well to a visual by showing the locations of the meteor crash sites, letting people click on them and learn more. I got a list of meteors from this [website](https://galactic-stone.com/pages/falls) and the coordinates for the meteors to map out the locations from this [one](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbull.cfm?code=84823&utm_source).

## **U.S. 2024 Election Interactive Visual**

This is an interactive map and chart I made based on data from the 2024 election. I chose this topic because I thought there was a lot of data for it out there, and it would be a good subject to visualize. Results from the map showed bigger dots on states that had more electoral votes, and the colors correlated with who won the state. The map shows that Harris won a couple of states with the most electoral votes like California, but Trump won more states overall which is why he won the election. The demographic table shows voters divided based on various categories such as gender, race, and education, and which candidate they leaned toward. Men leaned more to voting for Trump, especially men without degrees. People with degrees leaned more toward Harris, along with women. Majority of black population and minority groups voted for Harris, while majority of white population voted for Trump. Data was gathered from from a [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/exit-polls-2024-election/?) and official data from the [state election offices](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2024presgeresults.pdf).
