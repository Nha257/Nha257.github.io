I'm Noah H. Ali. I am currently a junior at Lehigh University in the College of Arts and Sciences. I am majoring in Science Journalism and Health, Medicine, and Society (HMS), as well as minoring in philosophy. That basically just means I do a lot of writing, and usually it is about science, health, or the way people think. Some of my hobbies are photography, creative writing, playing video games, and just asking a lot of questions.

This is an infographic I made regarding Lehigh Freshmen enrollments by college from 2015 to 2024:
