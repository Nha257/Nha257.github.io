I'm Noah H. Ali. I am currently a junior at Lehigh University in the College of Arts and Sciences. I am majoring in Science Journalism and Health, Medicine, and Society (HMS), as well as minoring in philosophy. That basically just means I do a lot of writing, and usually it is about science, health, or the way people think. Some of my hobbies are photography, creative writing, playing video games, and just asking a lot of questions.

This is an infographic I made regarding Lehigh Freshmen enrollments by college from 2015 to 2024:

This is another infographic I did regarding the Lehigh-Lafayette Rivalry:

This is an example timeline I did of the Lelaf game:

I did another timeline as well on the history of mascots at Lehigh. Some sources I used were [one about dogs at Lehigh](https://alumni.lehigh.edu/news-blog/dogs-lehigh#:~:text=Dogs%20in%20History,leaving%20her%20fraternity%20brothers%20bereft.), a 2013 Lehigh Sports article about [the Mountain Hawk](https://lehighsports.com/sports/2013/6/4/GEN_0604135643), a article about Lehigh [uniforms throughout history](https://lehighsports.com/news/2014/6/25/LL150_0625143915), and two _Brown and White_ articles about Clutch's history, one from [2021](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2021/11/19/from-engineers-to-mountain-hawks/) and the other from [2022.](https://thebrownandwhite.com/2022/11/18/the-clutch-experience-history-and-impact-of-lehighs-mascot/#:~:text=By%20William%20Barnett%20November%2018,the%20students%20decided%20on%20Clutch.)

Here is a practice pie chart I did regarding enrollment for each Lehigh College in 2020:
<iframe title="Lehigh College Enrollments 2020" aria-label="Pie Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-siwDS" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/siwDS/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="575" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>

This is a line chart I made of enrollments in each Lehigh College from 2015 to 2024:
<iframe title="Lehigh Enrollment Data by College 2015-2024" aria-label="Line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-tFlWs" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/tFlWs/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="396" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>

This is a chart I made explaining the outcomes of animals in U.S. shelters of the year 2024:
<iframe title="Results of Shelter Animals Outcomes in 2024" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-QsqTg" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QsqTg/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="463" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>
Live outcomes include things such as adoptions, returning animals to owners, return-to-field, and other things along those lines. Non-live outcomes are things such as euthanasia, animals being lost, or dying in care. On a positive note, there are way more live-outcomes than non-live ones, as indicated by the graph. There are also more animals being added to shelters and taken care of then animals being taken out of them, though the gap is on the smaller end. This is most likely due to shelters being overwhelmed and a lack of resources, showing these areas need improvement. Data was collected from [Shelter Animal Count's 2024 statistics](https://www.shelteranimalscount.org/explore-the-data/statistics-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

This is a map I made in class of the world's top 20 bicycling cities:
